      <h2>Recording of "The End"</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The idea for guitar solos was very spontaneous and everybody said, ‘Yes! Definitely’ – well, except for George, who was a little apprehensive at first. But he saw how excited John and Paul were so he went along with it. Truthfully, I think they rather liked the idea of playing together, not really trying to outdo one another per se, but engaging in some real musical bonding.</p>
        <p>Yoko was about to go into the studio with John – this was commonplace by now – and he actually told her, ‘No, not now. Let me just do this. It’ll just take a minute.’ That surprised me a bit. Maybe he felt like he was returning to his roots with the boys – who knows?</p>
        <p>The order was Paul first, then George, then John, and they went back and forth. They ran down their ideas a few times and before you knew it, they were ready to go. Their amps were lined up together and we recorded their parts on one track.</p>
        <p>You could really see the joy in their faces as they played; it was like they were teenagers again. One take was all we needed. The musical telepathy between them was mind-boggling.</p>

      <h2>Recording of "Maxwell's Silver Hammer"</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Paul ... responds to the news that George now has equal standing as a composer with John and himself by muttering something mildly provocative. "I thought until this album that George's songs weren't that good," he says, which is a pretty double-edged compliment since the earlier compositions he's implicitly disparaging include Taxman and While My Guitar Gently Weeps.</p>
        <p>There's a nettled rejoinder from George: "That's a matter of taste. All down the line, people have liked my songs." John reacts by telling Paul that nobody else in the group "dug" his Maxwell's Silver Hammer ... and that it might be a good idea if he gave songs of that kind – which, John suggests, he probably didn't even dig himself – to outside artists in whom he had an interest ...</p>
        <p>"I recorded it," a drowsy Paul says, "because I liked it."</p>
